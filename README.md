# Invisiface
InvisiFace is a computer vision project that reconstructs mask-covered facial regions using facial landmark detection and image inpainting. It uses MediaPipe FaceMesh to locate facial features and OpenCV to restore occluded areas, helping improve face recognition accuracy under real-world occlusion conditions.
